BecFlix is a film and television organizational app that upon completion will have the capabilities 
to store all of the movies and tv shows that you want to watch.  It will organize them in a variety
of ways including organized by personal ranking system, genre, franchise, release date, actor, director
and more.  It will help you to remember to watch those movies that slip through the cracks.  It will
remind you of shows that you want to rewatch from when you were a kid.  It will give you suggestions on
what to watch.
